# Strapi-CMS-with-jQuery
An example of how to use Strapi APIs with jQuery.
***

**How to use**

* Clone/download the repo.
* cd into strapiApp.
* run ```npx strapi start```. Strapi should now be running.
* Open strapiMain.html.
* Clicking the button should perform a 'get' request to the running Strapi app, returning everything in the 'testcs' content type.
***
Editing the Strapi and HTML code should be easy as the code has been kept to a bare minimum.
